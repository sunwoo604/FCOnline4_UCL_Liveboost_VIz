# FCOnline4 2022-2023 UEFA Champions League Live Boost Visualization

FCOnline is a online soccer game based on the real soccer players. There are certain versions of players in the game to reflect their actual performance in the Champions League and this always brought people's attention. In order to have better understanding the relationship between players' different stats(playing time, goals, assist, etc) and their boosts, I have made this visualization.

## Data Source
Most of the data is web scraped from UCL page and official FCOnline4 website. Data Collecting process is in the notebooks folder.

## Setup
In order to make D3.js functional, you have to use live server. You can utilize live server extension ins VS code and go live on index.html
