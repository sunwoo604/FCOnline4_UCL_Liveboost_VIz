# FCOnline4 2022-2023 UEFA Champions League Live Boost Visualization

FCOnline is an online soccer game based on real soccer players. There are certain versions of players in the game to reflect their actual performance in the Champions League and this always brought people's attention. In order to have a better understanding of the relationship between players' different stats(playing time, goals, assists, etc) and their boosts, I have made this visualization.
